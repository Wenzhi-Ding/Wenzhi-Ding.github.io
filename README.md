# plainwhite

Simplistic Jekyll portfolio-style theme for writers.

This is a template forked from [samarsault](https://github.com/samarsault/plainwhite-jekyll), but since I have done significant personalization and changes, if you would like to use this template, please be sure to credit both of us in this README file and LICENSE file.

## License

The theme is available as open source under the terms of the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).

## Notes from Wenzhi
- `serve.sh` is Linux shell script to conveniently start the Jekyll server. (Yes, I am super lazy :)

## Manually adopt master's changes

Update to 56fc0ecfdf81fff4d42c954d40397d4035a0f2f8. Not follow their most recent changes (only add email icon). If you want to use more icons, you can export your own Fontello files.
