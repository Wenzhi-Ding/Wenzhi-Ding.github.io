### PyReminder

- Version: 0.1.1
- Release date: Oct 28, 2019
- GitHub repo: <a class='icon-ext-link' href='https://github.com/Wenzhi-Ding/py_reminder' target="_blank">Link</a>

This is a Python decorator that can send email as notification. After append this decorator to the function, once the function finished, it will send you an email. This is especially useful in two scenarios:

- **Routine task**: Some automation tasks executing daily, you may want an email to tell you whether it goes well or has problem.
- **Time-consuming task**: For example, machine learning or large dataset processing, an email notification can let you safely work on other things and come back at right time.

### Error Catcher

- Version: 0.2
- Release date: Dec 24, 2020
- GitHub repo: <a class='icon-ext-link' href='https://github.com/Wenzhi-Ding/error_catcher' target="_blank">Link</a>

This is a convenient Python decorator to catch the errors information. Meanwhile, it can also capture the value of (1) variables related to that error or (2) other variables you interested at the time the error occurs. It support logging as well as printing directly. In short, this tool is more advanced and convenient than the original `try & except` statement in handling errors.

### Standardize Country Code

- Version: 0.1
- Release date: [will release in spare time]
- GitHub repo: [will release in spare time]

This tool helps researcher to standardize the country names from various data source into uniformed country code. 

This is designed in two forms:
- For Python users, you can install the package, import, and use the function directly.
- For other language users, you can download the dataset in different format and merge into your own dataset.
- Package for Stata and R are in the future supporting list.
