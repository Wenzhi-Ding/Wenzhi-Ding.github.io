with Chen Lin, Thomas Schmid, Michael S. Weisbach. **Working Paper**. <a class='icon-ext-link' href='' target="_blank">SSRN</a><br/><br/>What makes independent directors perform their monitoring duty? One possible reason is that they are worried about being sanctioned by regulators if they do not monitor sufficiently well. Using unique features of Chinese financial markets, we estimate the extent to which changes in a director’s perception of the likelihood of her receiving a regulatory penalty affects her monitoring. Our results suggest that independent directors are more likely to vote against the management after they observe that another director in their board network received a regulatory penalty for negligence. This effect is stronger if the connected penalized director shares the same professional background and gender with the director who votes, and if the voting director is at a firm that is more likely to be penalized. These results provide direct evidence suggesting that the possibility of receiving penalties is an important factor motivating directors.<br/><br/><img src="/assets/img_post/BoardVote_Dynamics.svg" style="width: 60vw" class="center"/>
