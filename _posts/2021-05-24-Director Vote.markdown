We study what makes the independent directors change their voting behaviors, based on the 2.8 million votes collected. We use board network and penalty event of connected directors as exogenous shocks to make causal inference. We find that a director is twice more likely to dissent if a connected director has been penalized.

# 1. Abstract

What makes independent directors perform their monitoring duty? Using director-level voting data from Chinese listed firms, we show that independent directors are more likely to vote against the management after they observe that another director in their board network received a regulatory penalty for negligence. This effect is stronger if the connected penalized director shares the same professional background and gender with the director who votes. This finding indicates that regulatory penalties generate spillover effects that make it more likely that directors perform their fiduciary responsibilities diligently.
